/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Readme for project 1b submission.
	Developed by: #undef TEAMNAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/

The purpose of this readme is to note a few assumptions/modifications
we have made to the language at the bequest of Harald who has given
permission to make these changes.

1. We are assuming interval terminals in array declaration are non-negative

2. We allow both binary and unary minus operators to work regardless
   of whitespace

3. Floating point precision does not matter in the pretty printer. The 
   alternatives are to store number of digits of precision alongside the 
   float (messy), or store as a string (inconsistent with boolean and 
   integer values), so this is the least of three evils.

Please contact any of the group members should you have any additional
concerns. 

Cheerio,

#undef TEAMNAME
