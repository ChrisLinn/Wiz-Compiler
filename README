/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Readme for final COMP90045 submission.
	Developed by: #undef TEAMNAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/

The purpose of this readme is to note a few assumptions/modifications
we have made to the language at the bequest of Harald who has given
permission to make these changes. Then we note the extra details and usage
instructions for our wiz compiler.

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Language assumptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/

1. We are assuming interval terminals in array declaration are non-negative

2. We allow both binary and unary minus operators to work regardless
   of whitespace

3. Floating point precision does not matter in the pretty printer. The 
   alternatives are to store number of digits of precision alongside the 
   float (messy), or store as a string (inconsistent with boolean and 
   integer values), so this is the least of three evils.

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Wiz usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------*/

We have added several options to the compiler to accomodate for the various
new functions we have added. These additonal functions are as follows.

 	-f : compile with optimisation and output to the filename.oz
    -c : optimise and reduce expressions, printing the before
         after results along with any errors.
    -o : compile with optimisation and output to stdout.

These options are also available through the usage prompt printed when a user
enters "wiz" or "./wiz" without appropriate input options. We have separated
the optimisation options from compilation to allow users to choose to forgo 
these optimisations if they think best (i.e. if they're trying to be 'clever').
